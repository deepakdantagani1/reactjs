/**
 * ingle page applications (or a SPA) can work in different ways. One way a single page app loads is by downloading the entire site's 
 * contents all at once. This way, when you're navigating around on the site, everything is already available to the browser, and it 
 * doesn't need to refresh the page. Another way single page apps work is by downloading everything that's needed to render the page 
 * the user requested. Then when the user navigates to a new page, asynchronous JavaScript requests are made for just the content that was requested.
