/**
 * Controlled Components refer to components that render a form, but the "source of truth" for that form state 
 * lives inside of the component state rather than inside of the DOM. The benefits of Controlled Components are:
 * 
 * Instant input validation
 * Conditionally enable or disable buttons
 * Enforce input formats
